INTRODUCTION

	This is a dockapp that shows the usage of each core in the system.
	The dockapp splits into two displays, the upper one showing the common usage of the system and the
	lower display showing one graph per each core.

	It detects the number of cores and computes the usage to be represented as a bar graph.
	wmcore works with a variable number of cores, I have tested the display with 1 up to 16 (simulated) cores.

PURPOSE
